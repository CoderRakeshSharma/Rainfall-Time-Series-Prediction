## Introduction

Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. This project utilizes historical rainfall data to develop predictive models, employing various time series analysis methods to forecast future rainfall amounts.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the following datasets:

- `rainfall-monthly-total.csv`: Contains monthly total rainfall measurements.
- `rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days.csv`: Records the number of rainy days per month.
- `rainfall-monthly-highest-daily-total.csv`: Details the highest daily rainfall recorded each month.

These datasets should be placed in the root directory of the project.

## Project Structure

- `Rainfall_TS_code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and model development code.
- `PRAICP-1004-Rainfall-TS.docx`: Documentation providing detailed insights into the project's methodology and findings.

## Usage

To explore and utilize the rainfall prediction models:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CoderRakeshSharma/Rainfall-Time-Series-Prediction.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Rainfall-Time-Series-Prediction
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Install necessary packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: Ensure that a `requirements.txt` file is present with all necessary dependencies listed.)*
4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Rainfall_TS_code.ipynb
   ```
5. **Run the Notebook**:
   Execute the cells in the notebook to perform data analysis and view the rainfall predictions.

## Results

The models developed in this project provide insights into rainfall trends and offer forecasts based on historical data. Detailed results, including visualizations and model evaluations, are available in the `Rainfall_TS_code.ipynb` notebook and the accompanying documentation `PRAICP-1004-Rainfall-TS.docx`.
